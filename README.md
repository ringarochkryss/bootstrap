Bootstrap-training with Code institute

https://ringarochkryss.github.io/bootstrap/.

Training on Bootstrap -code along. Teacher made a whiskey-subscription-site so I made one for Vodka.
Or
O made two, index and starting2 -two versions where I tried different things in BS.
The index was made first and doesnt contain as many tekniques as index. However the advantage of that
is that here -the nav works.
In starting2 I bumped into problems with getting the nav working -wich I havn't been able to fix.
I also had problems with the button in the jumbotrone. It works now but I actually wanted it in another class
with a background image. The image was fine but then the button didn't work and I don't know why. 
So I just use the BS default button and commented out all css-fixing with the button. A good looking button that doesn't work
is not a good button anyway.
But since I only studied for a week I will move on anyway -with just a litte hard to sleep at night.

A third file is a "write-your-name-in-the-Bootstrap-grid"-challenge.
